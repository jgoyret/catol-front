the not sent message, to what is not mine, to the violence of modernity, to the smiles of friends, to the hug of honest reconciliation, to morning sex, to the fear or hurting a beloved, to the shyness, to the healing, to the looking at that eyes, to the transmutations, to the night i didnt come, to try, to the fragility of being there, to the sand under my feet, to the smell of her sex, to the people i don’t remember, to the lost stories, to the fears, to the places i couldnt go, to the self im not, to the pillow i lost, to the things i abandoned, to the dreams i forgot, to the body i cant have, to the loud laughter, to the hug we gave, to the eyes of her, to the lips of them, to the smell of his, to the fear of death, to the joy of dying, to the failure, to the attempt, to the laughing crises, to the brokenness of insisting, to the dream of last night, to the dances

constante queda 
en suspenso, esperando 

o tombo do mundo em escombros sem 
cessar cessar cessar 
como fechar o canal aberto 

arrebatamento de rebento bento que grita pra rezar 
igual santo perdido na perdicao do sagrado da curva na rua que cruza 
e grita gargalhadas fortes na cara do tombamento 

arrebata a r r e b a t a as falhas fala pra tentar escutar 
o arrebatamento depois do rebento que segue constante na queda desse ceu 
esse ceu desse mundo que precisa acabar 
matar arrebentar qual tu ve qual 


um arrebatamento de amor 
sempre um arrebatamento da vida, me arrebata por favor? 
to te esperando no arrebatamento tombado do tempo que passa `,

I say sorry to my plants
for how i believe in something

shaking moving performance
to articulate the thing
it’s not about me

listening turning turning
gaze
lazy&horny
I miss others - the gatherings

I feel surrounded
pleasure

tiredness(resources)(conditions)
exposures
I don’t care about aesthetics
(the concern of the market!)

incorporation

labor

Im not creating anything 
edges 
resistances&surrendering 

moving host 
dancing the dance that is there 

common

fantasies

poetics

i often feel like a visitor 
not knowing how to proceed 

formless 

call in

Touch distance

I dont want my practice to become a threat 
to create *shows*

validations 

rereading my body

i have to find another dance 

resurfaced 

healing

it’s important to know how to gather

this dance was never about me. the trap the trap the trap. this is not about me, im just there. leave me alone. 

there is a hybrid of body and image 

look look look 

im not there - i dont care about identifying/ and its not in movement, because im tired. im not in movement. Im tired.

sleeping sleeping sleeping 

my body as an offer. dont make it about me. my body as an offer. how hard it is to sustain

to find the stone silence inside every cilia dancing into healing 
the alliances the trust the smiles oh how many eyes i see in my thoughts right now 
how many melting chests and pleasant feelings and so many turns how many turns and learning and aging and respect your tears your sweat the salt waters on those last months and i also realized my first wrinkles craving my face feels good on me the after 30 arriving my vertebras my flehs my face all changing while the mg of gel are part of my blood bleeding i was bleeding that night and i could lick you for hours high memories of touches and suddenly carnaval happened as in a dream sometimes all this that is happening right now feels like a dream because the spiral of time just drives me i surrender i surrender please take me i know you like it i can give it to you and and then the early morning jet leg things circulating in my blood circulation pleasure delightful in my back circulations to help me to cope with this whole situation please please please dont ask me what i need also dont ask me how is it going let me tell about the horoscopes and tell me your love life and your fears and pleasures how are you dancing with it right now you know that i know that you know that the dreams well whatever time passes the flow of words just get me as urgent as your scream as urgent as the end of this whole shit and all these that we remain escaping but then why why why there is no way to get it anyway and i get anxious with the days and i get pleasures out of actually needing to move with your smell in my fingers
