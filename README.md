# 🌈 Catol Teixeira – Artist Portfolio

> A custom-built, immersive web portfolio designed for artist **Catol Teixeira**, blending performance, visual experimentation, and kuir expression through technology.


## ✨ About the Project

This website was created as a digital extension of Catol Teixeira’s artistic practice.  
Catol is a trans-kuir dancer and choreographer whose work explores embodiment, transformation, and poetic resistance through movement. The site reflects this identity through carefully crafted design choices and dynamic visual elements.

A defining feature of the site is the use of **real-time GLSL visuals** generated with [`hydra-synth`](https://github.com/ojack/hydra).
